- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascirpt EventListener

### What I learned

I learned a lot about applying js to my projects and how to manipulate content in disappearing and reappearing using css and js. Espescially, how to make two different classes and then toggle them on and off. It took me a good 3-4 hours to complete divided in two days but it was worth it. Doing projects like this made me interested in web dev again when I was getting bored and frustrated after only learning from tutorials with no real work being done.
